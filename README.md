# abm-intervention

This is the code repository for the Attentional Bias Modification (ABM) intervention treatment task for depression, developed at the University of Texas at Austin, and adapted at the National University of Singapore. 

The task was written using [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/).

## Setup

This repository contains both the frontend and the backend for the task. First, run these commands to set up the git submodules:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Follow the instructions for the backend and, once it is setup and deployed, you may begin the experiment from the frontend through `index.html`.
